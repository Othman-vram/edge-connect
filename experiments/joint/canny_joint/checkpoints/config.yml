EXPERIMENT_NAME: Canny Joint Blurred External Mask  # experiment name
# MLflow run ID:
# - If it is your first time running the code, leave this empty to create a new run.
# - Set this if you want to continue training from a previous run and log results in the same location.
# - To do this, go to the MLflow UI, find the specific experiment, and copy the run ID of the run you want to continue.
# - If not specified, MLflow will create a new run each time, and your plots will be grouped in separate runs.
# - Leave it empty to allow MLflow to automatically handle the run ID by default.
# - Example Empty value: MLFLOW_RUN_ID:  
# - Example with run ID: MLFLOW_RUN_ID: 1eb8039733de4d4eb0a6d9ddc260d04 (This value was copied from the MLflow UI)
